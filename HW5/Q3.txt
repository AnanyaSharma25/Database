 Sum refers to the addition of a company's Profits over all 'n' years that it has been active.
Average refers to the the sum of the profits of the companies divided by the 'n' years it has been active. 

So essentially, sum tells us the total profit obtained over all the years.

Average tells us the profit that would have been for the company per year i.e. what is the benchmark value of profits for the company. Tells us the stability of a company.

Hence, although a company's sum may be the highest but it doesn't mean its profits over all n years were almost the same, thus not giving it a high average.

That is why the top three companies in the 'sum' chart are different from the top three in 'average'.
